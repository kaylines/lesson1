           <i> The <b>English Wikipedia</b> has pioneered some ideas as conventions, policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas include "featured articles",[5]
             the neutral-point-of-view policy,[6] navigation templates,[7] 
            the sorting of short <u>"stub" </u>articles into sub-categories,[8] dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[9] and weekly collaborations.</i>
